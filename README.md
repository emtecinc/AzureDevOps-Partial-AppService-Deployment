# Azure Web App - Partial package deployment for Micro Frontend architecture 
This task is used to upload the partial or full Web App deployment package on Azure Web App through Kudu Rest API.
## Introduction
This task is created because, in the Micro Frontend end release and development, we need the ability to upload a partial set of directories (depending on the module being released) from the Web Application's directory on Azure Web App.   

The default Azure Web App Deploy task provides the ability to deploy and replace the entire package from the application's directory on the Azure Web App. But in the Micro Frontend architecture applications, different developers can be working on different independent Micro Frontend apps and suppose a development team wants to push only one Micro Frontend apps changes on the live environment, this partial deployment ability is not available in the default Azure deployment task. Using this task users can upload the partial or full Web App deployment package.

This extension also provides the functionality to the backup of the existing wwwroot directory if Azure storage settings are configured.

Note: This extension with set the website application setting variable WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE to 0, so that KUDU can replace the files/folders.
